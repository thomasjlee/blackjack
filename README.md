### Simplified Blackjack

`blackjack.rb` contains initial work on a Blackjack simulation.

Your implementation should satisfy the following use cases and Blackjack rules:

 * As a Player I can get a hand with two cards in it
 * As a Dealer I can get a hand with two cards in it
 * As a Player I can see what card the dealer is showing
 * As a Player I can bust (lose immediately) when I am getting cards
 * As a Player I can blackjack (win immediately) when I am dealt cards (this is a simplification)
 * As a Dealer I can draw cards after the player until I win or lose

**Rules:**

 * Bust - Occurs when all possible hand values are greater than 21 points
 * Blackjack - Occurs when a player or dealer is dealt an ace and a 10-point card
 * Dealer - Stays on 17 or above

Please use your discretion in fixing/adding tests. You are free to use/convert to any testing framework you want.

**Optional:**

 * Simulate a random round of the game (you don't have to write educated player decision logic - it could be just guesses)
